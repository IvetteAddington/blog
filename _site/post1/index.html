    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
      <p>A few weeks ago I met someone at a tech meetup who had recently relocated to the States from South America. Once we started chatting, she told me she was excited to see a thriving community of women in tech. Back home she really only heard of two women in tech, Marissa Meyers and Sheryll Sandburg. Those ladies certainly deserve name recognition, but she was so excited to know that there was a larger community of women making a name for themselves in tech. </p>

<p>After that chat, I was inspired to finally start the blog I&rsquo;d wanted to write about my own experiences in tech, but also wanted to make it bilingual. I did a fair amount of research on hosting a multilingual site. After some research I came across articles talking about the new healthcare.gov website. The developers commissioned with creating this site used Jekyll, a simple, static site generator without a relational database. I was skeptical at first, but its ease a great documentation really made choosing to go with jekyll a no brainer. As a single language blog, Jekyll is pretty much ready to run as soon as the gem is installed and ran, but making the blog multilingual took a bit more work. </p>

<p>Creating this blog had its fair share of both highs and lows, getting one language to work was fairly straigt forward- Jekyll actually sets you up from the beginning, but making this blog bi-lingual took some work. </p>

<p>You’ll find this post in your <code>_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code>jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code>_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code>YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Tom&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></div>
