The first time I used environmental variables was in Ruby program, which is probably why I often forget there is one more step when using them in a javascript app. This is one of those posts that I'm sure I'll be coming back to myself, but hope it's helpful for someone else out there. 

###First, what is an environmental variable?###
I want to start out by saying, there are probably more technical terms/explanations than the following, but in its simplest form (at least the way I understand it), its like a variable that is set on your machine and can be accessed system-wide. 

###Why do I need them?###
They come in really handy when you start working with API client keys, IDs, OAuth, sensitive information, etc. How so? When working on client projects or even just playing around with API's, we are often given information that serves as a password of sort. 

Say you are working on a personal project and you push your code to Github, all the code, including all those IDs, keys, passwords are now out there for everyone to see. In all honesty, this may not be too consequential in some cases, but it can easily have cause major problems I would rather avoid. This is when environmental variables come in handy.

I store environmental variables in my <html><a href="http://natelandau.com/my-mac-osx-bash_profile/" target="_blank">bash profile</a></html>. There are various ways to access it, but I open it through <html><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">SublimeText</a></html>. 

{% highlight ruby %}
subl ~/.bash_profile
{% endhighlight %}

This sets the variable in bash

{% highlight ruby %}
export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
{% endhighlight %}

Now to get it and use it. 

For Ruby:
The first time I worked with environmental variables, I was learning about OAuth with Github-

{% highlight ruby %}

ENV["GITHUB_CLIENT_ID"]

{% endhighlight%}

to shorten it, I assigned it to another variable
{% highlight ruby %}

client_id = ENV["GITHUB_CLIENT_ID"]

{% endhighlight%}

and called it on line 8
{% highlight ruby linenos %}

get "/" do
	base_url = "https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize"
	state = SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64
	session["state"] = state
	query ={
		state: state,
		scope: "user",
		client_id: client_id,
	}

{% endhighlight%}

For Javascript:
In this case, I was using Instagram's API and wanted to keep my client ID hidden using Node, but overall same concept. 

The bash profile step is the same 

{% highlight ruby %}

export INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

{% endhighlight %}

In my code, I assigned it to a variable and then used it in my request 
{% highlight ruby %}

var apiKey = process.env.INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID;

request('https://api.instagram.com/v1/tags/' + searchTerm + '/media/recent?client_id=' + apiKey, function(error, response, body)...

{% endhighlight %}

One more step here, in the same terminal window you are using to run the app, run the following

{% highlight ruby %}

source ~/.bash_profile

{% endhighlight %}

It's that last step that I often forget and inspired this post.
