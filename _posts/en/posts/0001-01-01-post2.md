When I started to plan the functionality of this blog, I wanted the site's navigation to change according the the user's choice of language, while giving the option to easily switch back and forth from one language to another. Jekyll made it pretty easy to create the custom data to generate the site desired functionality by using the _data folder. 

Jekyll's _data folder comes in handy when you want to use additional data to generate a site. In my case, I wanted two sets on navigation- one for each language. So, inside the _data folder I created a navigation.yml file.

{% highlight ruby %}

├── _data
│   └── navigation.yml

{% endhighlight %}

In the navigation.yml file I created two sets of navigations- one in English(en) and one in Spanish(es). The "title" is what will appear on the site, with its corresponding "url" below it. One thing to keep in mind here- YAML (like Python) is pretty specific about its whitespace, so make sure to use the spacebar instead of tab for spacing. 

{% highlight ruby linenos%}

en:
  posts:
    title: "Posts"
    url: "/index/"
  projects:
    title: "Projects"
    url: "/projects/"
  about:
    title: "About"
    url: "/about/"

es:
  entradas: 
    title: "Entradas"
    url: "/entradas/"
  proyectos:
    title: "Proyectos"
    url: "/proyectos/"
  acerca:
    title: "Acerca De"
    url: "/acerca-de/"

{% endhighlight %}

To complete the navigation functionality, In my default.html I looped through navigation.yml according to the current [page.lang]- seen on lines two through eight below. This code allows the user to navigate through the rest of the site in the languge the user is requesting. 

{% highlight ruby linenos%}
{% raw %}
            
<ul class="nav navbar-nav pull-right">
    {% for menu in site.data.navigation[page.lang] %}
    <li class="list-inline">
    	<a href="{{ menu[1].url }}">{{ menu[1].title }}</a>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

I also wanted the ability to transition from one language to another on the navigation, but only wanted the link to the alternate languge to show, otherwise, I thought the navbar may look too crowded and confusing since the user was already on one of the two languages. First on lines one and two, I had to create the variable to be able to loop through the posts. Then, on line four, I captured the language of the post and used that information to answer the if/else statement on lines five though thirteen. 

{% highlight ruby linenos%}
{% raw %}
    {% assign posts=site.posts | where:"name", page.name | sort: 'path' %} 
    {% for post in posts %}
    <li class="lang">
        {% capture language %}{{page.lang}}{% endcapture %} 
        {% if language == "es" %}
        	<a href="{{ post.url }}" class="{{ post.lang }}">
        		{{ post.lang | where: "post.lang", "en" | replace: "en", "English" | remove: "es" }}
        	</a> 
        {% else %}
        	<a href="{{ post.url }}" class="{{ post.lang }}">
        		{{ post.lang | where: "post.lang", "es" | replace: "es", "Español" | remove: "en" }}
        	</a> 
        {% endif %}
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}   

I then used the same format on the templates for projects and posts.
