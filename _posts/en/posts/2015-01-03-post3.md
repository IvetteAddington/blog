I‚Äôve used rbenv to update my Ruby dependencies in the past, usually without a problem. But, while trying to update to the Ruby's 2.2.3 version, I ran across this error: 

{% highlight ruby %}

$rbenv install 2.2.3

ruby-build: definition not found: 2.2.3
The following versions contain `2.2.3' in the name:
rbx-2.2.3

{% endhighlight %}

After double checking that the current stable version is in fact <html><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">2.2.3</a></html>, I looked into ways to update manually. The solution to this is in the ruby-build, a rbenv plugin that provides an install command to compile and install different versions of Ruby on UNIX-like systems. Additionally, I use a package manager, <html><a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a></html>, and the following commands worked for me. 

{% highlight ruby %}
$brew install ruby-build
	==> Downloading https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build/archive/v20150928.tar.gz
	==> Downloading from https://codeload.github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build/tar.gz/v20150928
	######################################################################## 100.0%
	==> ./install.sh
	üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/ruby-build/20150928: 172 files, 728K, built in 2 seconds
{% endhighlight %}

I then entered the following, which gave me a warning: 

{% highlight ruby %}
$brew link -f ruby-build
	Warning: Already linked: /usr/local/Cellar/ruby-build/20150928
	To relink: brew unlink ruby-build && brew link ruby-build
{% endhighlight %}

So I tried to update through git, which worked:

{% highlight ruby %} 
$cd ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build 	
$git pull

$rbenv global 2.2.3

$ruby -v
	ruby 2.2.3p173 (2015-08-18 revision 51636) [x86_64-darwin14]

{% endhighlight %}

I‚Äôm now up and running on the current stable version.
