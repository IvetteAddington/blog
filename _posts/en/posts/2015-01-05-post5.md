When I was asked to volunteer at this event, I remember thinking, REALLY? I just started learning to code, what in the world can I possibly contribute to this. But, in spite of the fear and doubts, I reluctantly agreed. For me, coding was taking me leaps out of my comfort zone, and I knew this was going to be no different. 

The day of the hackathon, I was so nervous. Nervous about showing my lack of knowledge, looking like an imposter, not being beneficial to the event. But here's the thing I learned that day- this was not about me. This was about a group of girls who wanted to spend a weekend coding and solving problems larger then themselves. Yes, they asked questions that I was not ready to answer, but like I had already been doing in class, we looked it up, solved it and moved on.

In retrospect, I'm glad I did not let my fear get the best of me. For more information about Ignite or how the day went, check out the post I wrote for
