It started with a tweet. This tweet, from <html><a href="http://women2.com/" target="_blank">Women 2.0</a></html> to be exact:

Well, let me back up. Before that tweet, I had spent a few months learning HTML and CSS. Through <html><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">Team Treehouse's online tutorials</a></html>, blog posts and John Duckett's <html><a href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/" target="_blank">HTML&CSS design and build websites</a></html> book, I created a webiste. It was nothing fancy, but it was a pretty great feeling to see working links, a responsive header (everything else was responsive too, but the header was where I can see the most transition) and something I created on my computer's screen. 

As the weeks past, I was reading and going through more complicated frontend tutorials and dipped my toes into backend as often as I could, but something was missing, and that was structure. I applaud the people who have been able to learn on their own, without classes, bootcamps, etc. There are a lot of resources out there, but I wanted to be in a class. I thought about going back to school, but then I saw the tweet about scholarships for women looking to learn to code. On that list, was <html><a href="https://generalassemb.ly/opportunity-fund" target="_blank">General Assembly's Opportunity Fund</a></html>. Since I received the scholarship, the format has changed a bit, and now all scholarships fall under three categories. But, I had specifically received the Alexis Ohanian Fellowship for Women of Color, which now falls under <html><a href="https://generalassemb.ly/opportunity-fund/fellowships/code-for-change" target="_blank">Code for Change</a></html>. Check it out- that's me in the Fellow Spotlight!

I was pretty scared to apply, for many reasons. For starters, if I did get a scholarship, that would mean quitting my job, while my husband was in school full-time. Also, I can work my way through problems, but I was no math or science whiz, so I was concerned that coding was out of my leauge. Honestly, I could keep going with the list of why nots, bu I got over the fears and applied anyway. I thought, what are the odds...

I few weeks later, I was called in for an interview, with both the Opportunity Fund Director and a teacher at General Assembly. Needless to say, I was pretty intimiated, but later that evening I was informed that I would be given the scholarship.

It's been a few months since I finished the program and had the privilage of teaching a Girls Who Code class in Harlem soon after I was done. I've been coding just about everyday since graduating, but I had planned to travel throughout the summer while my husband, Josh, finished school and an internsip, so I have postponed looking for a full-time job. Late last week, we Josh officially accepted a data science/web development job in Durham, NC. So were packing up and heading south! It's been a crazy few months, but I am so very excited to get involved with the thriving tech community in the Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill area of North Carolina.
