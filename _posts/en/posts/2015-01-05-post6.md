While at General Assembly, one of the first concepts we learned was how to work with arrays and hashes. They are common data types used to store and retrieve information. 

An example of an array would be

{% highlight ruby %}
	colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]
{% endhighlight %}

If I wanted all the colors, I would simply call "colors"

{% highlight ruby %}
	colors
	#=>[
	    [0] "red",
	    [1] "blue",
	    [2] "green"
	]

{% endhighlight %}

If I only one of the colors, I can call it by its index number, like so

{% highlight ruby %}
colors[0]
#=>"red"

colors[1]
#=>"blue"

colors[2]
#=>"green"
{% endhighlight %}

A hash looks like this

{% highlight ruby %}

fruit_colors = {"red" => "apple", "blue" => "blueberry", "green" => "lime"}

{% endhighlight %}

A hash has what we call key value pairs. In this case, the values are "red", "blue", "green" and the values, respectively, are "apple", "blueberry", and "lime."

Just like in the array example, what I just wanted to return "lime", I would call the key to get the value

{% highlight ruby %}

fruit_colors["green"]
#=>"lime"
	
{% endhighlight %}

Lets take a look at a hash with multiple values for one key

{% highlight ruby %}

fruit_colors = {"red" => ["apple", "strawberry"], "blue" => "blueberry", "green" => ["lime", "grape"]}

{% endhighlight %}

In this case, say I still want to get "lime", I would need to get the values of green and then treat them like array indexes, in this case "0"

{% highlight ruby %}

fruit_colors["green"][0]
#=> "lime"

{% endhighlight %}

Without adding the array index, you would get back all the values of the key.

{% highlight ruby %}

fruit_colors["red"]
#=>[
    [0] "apple",
    [1] "strawberry"
]
{% endhighlight %}

This was a pretty simple explanation, I'll go into nested arrays and hashes next, but for more usage info, visit the ruby docs on <html><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Array.html">arrays</a></html> and <html><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Hash.html">hashes</a></html>.
