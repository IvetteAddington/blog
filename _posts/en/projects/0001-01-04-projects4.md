###About this Project###
expressGram was my first attemp combining javascript, express, node and a third-party API, Instagram's API. I learned early on that in the developing world, documentation can be hit or miss, but in this case expess, node and Instagram all had thorough documentation. That being said, with or without good documentation, as a newbie I still struggled, so I was glad this eventually came together. 

###Challenges###
Getting through Instagram's documentation was a bit challenging. I metioned earlier that their documentation is thorough and very clear, but because this was one of the first APIs I had worked with, it was hard to tell what it was that I was looking for exactly and what information I needed from the docs to make my app work. As a newbie, I didn't know what all it all meant, some of the syntax was new to me, but playing around in their sandbox and looking at their examples was super helpful. 

I also stuggled with getting the environmental variable to work. Although I had the syntax correct, but I did't source the environmental variable it the terminal window and so the app would not crash, but all I would get back after the query was sent was a blank page. Honestly, that is more frustrating than reading through the error. I knew something was wrong, but without an error it was hard to look for an explanation. In the end, it was my husband who asked if I had ran the souce command to access the environmental variables. If this makes no sense to you, I wrote more about it <html><a href="http://ivetteaddington.com/post7/" target="_blank">here</a></html>. 

###Final Thoughts###
Working through this project gave me a great understanding of APIs. As, I've worked on other APIs, I've seen the same terminology and have a basic understanding of what is required to get the results I am looking for. As I look back on this, I can see where this app would benfit from being single page and the next iteration will incorporate a front end framework to get that done.
